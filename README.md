# SoccerT

This is a common repository of team 28. We have implemented all the user stories discussed in the sprint 1, and the above one is our working code, developed in the collaborative environment. 

The uploaded code includes following user stories (features).

- Homepage (as in login page)
- Dashborad
- User level roles (managed by the admin)
- Announcements (Articles) (managed by the admin, viewed by everyone)
- FAQ (managed by the admin, viewed by everyone)
- Change Password
- Log in/Log out mechanism

The code followed agile methodology along with the MVC design pattern where database was access by DOA.
